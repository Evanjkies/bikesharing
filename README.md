## Overview
The goal was to analyze bike sharing data from citibike in New York City and determine trends about the data to apply to a potential bike sharing business in Des Moine, Iowa.

### Top Ending Locations

This map shows where the highest desnity of bike dropoffs occur, represented by both circle size as well as circle color. The larger and darker the circle the more bikes are being droped off in that area.


### Checkout Times for Users

The graph shows the trip durations for every bike. Most trips were around 10minutes, and extremely few trips were beyond an hour.


### Checkout Times by Gender

This graph also shows the trip durations for every bike but it is seperated by gender. Many more bikes were checked out by males, but the trip duration does not change much by gender.


### Trips by Gender Pie Chart

This pie chart breaks down the number of trips taken by gender. As the previous chart showed, the majority of trips are taken by individuals identifying as male.


### User trips by Gender by Weekday
![Trips by Gender by Weekday Based on Subscribership](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107013312/191382024-8280253f-701a-4959-8019-ae60a817e9c9.png)

This chart breaks down the number of trips based on the day of the week, gender, and usertype. The darker the color blue appears in a cell, the more trips that were taken by that specific group on that specifc day. General customers are pretty evenly distributed but males dominate the subscribership.


### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Much like the chart above, this chart shows the number of trips taken, based on gender identification, the day of the week, and the time of day. The higher number of trips are represented by cell shaded in a darker color of blue. Males make up most of the data points regarding rides. Most rides occur on business days before and after a typical work shift. 


### Trips by Weekday per Hour

This chart is the same as the chart above except it is not broken down by gender. It also shows that Monday-Friday from 7-9am and 5-7pm is where the most trips occur.

## Results
Based on the data gathered:
- Males are the most frequent and populus customer 
- Trips are usually less than 30 minutes and rarely exceed an hour
- THe highest density of trips occurs after work between 5pm - 7pm on weekdays

### Two Additional Visualization Suggestions
- A graph that charts rides per day. This would be useful because it could highlight some key seasonal trends
- A chart that uses a heat map to represent the age/birth year of subscribers. This could help show areas of customers that may need to be targeted more or in a different manner.
